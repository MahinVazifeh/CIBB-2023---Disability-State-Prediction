Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive or alternate impairment of neurological functions (motor, sensory, visual, and cognitive). Predicting disease progression with a probabilistic and time-dependent approach might help in suggesting interventions that can delay the progression of the disease. However, extracting informative knowledge from irregularly collected longitudinal data is difficult, and missing data pose significant challenges. MS progression is measured through the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which quantifies and monitors disability in MS over time. EDSS assesses impairment in eight functional systems (FS). Frequently, only the EDSS score assigned by clinicians is reported, while FS sub-scores are missing. Imputing these scores might be useful, especially to stratify patients according to their phenotype assessed over the disease progression. This repository aimed at i) exploring different methodologies for imputing missing FS sub-scores, and ii) predicting the EDSS score using complete clinical data.
